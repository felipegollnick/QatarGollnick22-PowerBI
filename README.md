# QatarGollnick22
A World Cup Predictions Game developed on Power BI 

_(you could also call it "a betting game" but that's less charming)_

The aim was to develop a full project running mainly on Power BI while having real and brand new data that I have collected from real people.
Qatar Gollnick 22 happened while the World Cup action unfolded. Results were updated everyday, and so participants were informed about their updated standings and other interesting facts.

I needed to do all the steps in a proccess that went far beyond than the just the dashboard developing. Some of the main steps involved: 
- Data Cleaning;
- Data Modelling;
- DAX measures and M language;
- Data Visualization (Power BI and Flourish);
- User Experience;
- Customer Service and Community Moderating (as I used WhatsApp groups to update participants about their results and standings);
- And, before all of that, I had to look for participants who would be part of the game; Then I had to come up with questionnaires where they would send their guesses.

I have also designed the logo of the game.

You can read about the whole developing proccess [on my page on Medium](https://datagollnick.medium.com/). (still working in an English version of it)

Beside of the dashboard you can access on the above URL, I used Flourish to make an interactive chart of how the standings unfolded day by day. [Click here to see it in action.](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/14306171/)

And, for the Grand Final, as it is the single most important football match out there, I updated the standings after each goal. 
Luckily, Mbapp√© and Messi were eager to make history (and a lot of goals), thus bringing a lot of action to the participants [(click here to see the game action)](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/14306402/).
